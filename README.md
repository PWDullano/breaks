# breaks

Technologies used: PostGres, AngularJS, Node, Express, Bootstrap, Satellizer, KnexJS

I created this app with the hope of helping people get exposure with breakdancing.  The breakdown section gives a brief description of a breakdancing move with a youtube link to the best possible tutorial of said move, they can learn at their own pace.  The sessions section let's you make a session with what moves you want to focus in, hopefully building a good habit of scheduling/training.

1. To get this running fork and clone this repo, cd into the directory and npm install.
2. in terminal type "createdb breaks", to create the database
3. run "knex migrate:latest" and "knex seed:run"
4. run nodemon and go to localhost:3000
5. enjoy!
